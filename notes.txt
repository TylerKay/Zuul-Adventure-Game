Some notes:

Notes 6/22:
	- Take command: "take"
	- Drop command: "drop"
	- Items command: "items"
	- Eat command: "eat"

	- Maximum weight that player can carry can be modified in the Player class. I just set it to 50 for testing purposes but you could modify it to make more sense for your adventure game.
	- Magic cookie increases maximum "inventory" weight a player can hold by 20. You can modify this by changing 20 to some other number.

	- Battle command: "battle"

			bastion, jungle temple chest room, desert temple, crimson forest 3, and lab
